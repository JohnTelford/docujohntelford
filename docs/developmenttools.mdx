## Git and GitHub

:::tip


[Git and GitHub Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_intro.asp?remote=github) website is a way to get an understanding of [Git](#git) and [Github](#github). Use it to better understand this website page material.

[GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) is a Microsoft product available on Mac and Windows. It interacts with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. Use GitHub Desktop for many Git commands such as pushing to, pulling from, and cloning remote repositories, attributing commits, and creating pull requests, with visual confirmation of changes.

[Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/) is a more in depth Git resource 

:::

The core technologies of Iterative Development are [Git](#git), [GitHub](#github) central project repository controlled by the project gatekeeper, and a content delivery network, like [Cloudflare](#deploy/cloudflare), where Internet production websites and individual team private [Preview](deploy#preview) Internet websites, are deployed.

### GitHub

GitHub is a Distributed Version Control Systems enabling multiple teams to work separately on the same project without having an impact on the work of others. GitHub manages an online web hosted central project repository containing all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes.

> It helps answer the questions for the lifetime of the project *who changed what, where, when, and why?* 

Team members use the [Website Development Stack](website-development-stack) to develop and deploy websites to the Internet.

### The GitHub Workflow

GitHub workflow is centered on [Pull Requests](#pull-request). The GitHub workflow works with collaborating tightly-knit team members contributing to the central project repository using the [Forks](#fork). It is centered on the topic [Branches](#branch) workflow.

A summary of GitHub workflow for each team member is:

1. [Fork](#fork) the central project repository creating a local project repository in individual team members GitHub account
2. [Clone](#clone) the forked local project repository in team member GitHub account to workstation
1. Creates a topic [branch](#branch) off the cloned local project repository *develop* branch
1. Make topic edits and commits 
2. Push after each commit to the cloned local project repository in GitHub account
3. Periodicity [Pull](#pull) from the central project repository. The *develop* branch will have merged accepted [Pull Request](#pull-request)
3. Deploy local project repository to a private website periodically for stake holders viewing. This reduces the [Pull Request](#pull-request) evaluation time because stake holders interested in topics can see how they are progressing and working with the website.
4. Open a [Pull Request](#pull-request) on the GitHub local project repository to begin the  process of integrating the local project repository with the central project repository  
1. Team members discuss, and optionally continue committing on [Pull Requests](#pull-request).

The project gatekeeper merges or closes Pull Requests to the central project repository, and deploys the central project repository to a private website for stack holders viewing. The teams and gatekeeper continues the GitHub workflow process until stack holders agree the central project repository is ready for release to the public internet 

Teams may [Pull](#pull) the central project repository at anytime to view and test other topic branches.

## Git Desktop

An alternative to using [VScode](#vscode) built-in [Git](git-github#git) commands is to use [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop). It abstract Github and more Git commands. It interacts with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. 


[GitHub Desktop and VSCode](http://www.rodanthi-alexiou.com/github-101-github-desktop-and-vscode/) documents how to use GitHub Desktop with [VSc ode](#vscode).
