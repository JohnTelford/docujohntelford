:::info
All developers need a `GitHub` account. It is a Microsoft company
"[`GitHub`](https://github.com/) is a Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) enabling multiple developers or teams to work separately without having an impact on the work of others. GitHub is a central online web hosted project repository for all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes. Teams can view history of all changes and go back to previous file versions."

GitHub is a unified source of truth helping to answer the questions _who_ changed _what_, _where_, _when_, and _why_?
