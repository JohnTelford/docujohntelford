![vscodelogo](/img/vscodelogo.png)

:::info
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VScode) editor is a Microsoft product.
:::

It has become the goto editor for many. It is free, built on open source, and runs everywhere.

[VScode](#vscode) is the command and control center for the website development stack.

The development command and control tasks are:

- Editing Markdown and MDX text and [Troika](programming#troika) web programming materials
- Use [GitHub](git-github/#github) and [Git](git-github/#github) to manage project files. Git is built-in and optimized to work with Microsoft GitHub
- Editor tool [Extensions](#extensions) continually check for syntax and other errors
- Live edit browser previews show how edits will look when deployed
- Deploy secure website previews to the Internet for stakeholders
- Deploy production website to the Internet
- Built-in command shell
- And **much** more

### Extensions

Useful extensions are:

- Dark+ Material.  
The default Dark+ theme, using Material's color palette

## Git Desktop

An alternative to using [VScode](#vscode) built-in [Git](git-github#git) commands is to use [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop). It abstract Github and more Git commands. It interacts with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser.
