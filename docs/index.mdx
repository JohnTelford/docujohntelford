# Introduction

This website was created by [johntelford.com LLC](company). It is about optimizing website project life time costs using a static site generator for developing and deploying websites. It is based on *Iterative Development* and *Web Component Technologies*.

---

This website is the  latest of many [John Telford](https://johntelford.com) blog and website reincarnations over the years. 

Way back when the internet was young, while researching I discovered blog and website static site generator technologies, that seemed to bring something new to the party .

I sometimes do learn by doing, by taking deep technology dives by programming the next blog or website reincarnations using the technology du jour.
