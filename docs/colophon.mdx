## Website Components

This site is built using website components :

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator. It is an open-source website framework created and open-sourced by [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/). It builds a single-page application with a fast client-side navigation, leveraging React to make websites interactive.

- Some features I like about Docusaurus are:
    - Powered by React,JSX and MDX
    - Extend and customize with React
    - Hot web browser reloading with fast incremental build on edit changes
    - Route-based code and data splitting
    - Check for errors by building deployment website on local server, using the same process as the deployment server
    - Search
	    - [Algolia DocSearch](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search#using-algolia-docsearch)
	    - Local Search - Small and can be downloaded to browsers 
    - Menues
	    - Leftside - menu bar
	    - Blog left side - posts
	    - Rightside - page / post table of contents

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created and open-sourced by [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/) . 


- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) built for the component age. It has identical syntax as Markdown. MDX is an author-able format that enables seamlessly writing [JSX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/#jsx) components in MDX documents. One can import React components such as user interfaces, interactive charts, alerts or other components.
