![vscodelogo](/img/vscodelogo.png)

:::info
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VScode) editor is a Microsoft product.
:::

It has become the goto editor for many. It is free, built on open source, and runs everywhere.

`VScode` is the command and control center for the website development stack.

The development command and control tasks are:

- Editing Markdown and MDX text and [Troika](programming#troika) web programming materials
- Use `git` and `GitHub` to manage project files. `Git`is built-in and optimized to work with Microsoft `GitHub`
- Editor tool [Extensions](#extensions) continually check for syntax and other errors
- Live edit browser previews show how edits will look when deployed
- Deploy secure website previews to the Internet for stakeholders
- Deploy production website to the Internet
- Built-in command shell
- And **much** more

### Extensions

Useful extensions are:

- Dark+ Material.  
The default Dark+ theme, using Material's color palette

- ESlint.  
Integrates ESLint JavaScript into VS Code

- GitHub Repositories.

- Lorem Text Generator

- Rainbow Brackets

- Todo Tree  
This extension quickly searches (using ripgrep) your workspace for comment tags like TODO and FIXME, and displays them in a tree view in the activity bar

- vscode-icons

#### Git Client

VScode built-in git commands :

 - Review diffs, 
 - Stage files
 - Make commits
 - Push 
 - pull 

### Git Desktop

An alternative to using these built-in VScode commands is to use [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop). It abstract Github and more Git commands. It interacts with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. 

[GitHub Desktop and VSCode](http://www.rodanthi-alexiou.com/github-101-github-desktop-and-vscode/) documents how to use GitHub Desktop with VScode.
