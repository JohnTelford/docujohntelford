:::info
Deploying a website is making it available on the Internet. The production version is deployed when stakeholders agree. Meanwhile, developers working on features, fixes, or testing may deploy private website with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the production version. This enables the stakeholders to monitor progress.

## Deployment

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs#features) supports static site hosting services such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com), and others. I have used these and other hosting services. My choice is Cloudflare.

### Cloudflare

This website is using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) for website deployment.
Cloudflare builds websites and deploys them when `git` pushes changes from the _Local Repository_ to the _Central Repository_, Cloudflare then automatically builds the website and deploys to the Internet.

Some benefits deploying projects with Cloudflare are:

- Security
- Performance
- Stability

Some features I like are:

- Automatic website deployment after a push to the GitHub repository for production websites. Team members may show their new features they are working or their remediation of defects by deploying their local repository  to a secure website where stockholders view their work and give feedback.
- Command line deployments using the `vercel` app.
- Builds are quick, especially those with few changes.
- Redeploy previous deployments and look at the code used to generate them.
